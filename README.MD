# Password Manager

A simple and secure password manager that allows users to add and view encrypted passwords using the `cryptography` library. This application encrypts passwords for safety and stores them in a text file.

## Features

- **Add Passwords**: Securely store your passwords by encrypting them.
- **View Passwords**: Retrieve and decrypt your stored passwords in a user-friendly format.
- **Encryption**: Utilizes the `Fernet` symmetric encryption to ensure that passwords are securely stored.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library
- `pandas` (for potential future use)
- `numpy` (for potential future use)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:

   You can install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install cryptography pandas numpy
   ```

3. **Generate a Key**:

   You need a key for encryption. You can generate a key by running the following code snippet:

   ```python
   from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

   key = Fernet.generate_key()
   with open('key.key', 'wb') as key_file:
       key_file.write(key)
   ```

   This will create a file named `key.key` in your project directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:

   Start the password manager by running:

   ```bash
   python password_manager.py
   ```

2. **Manage Your Passwords**:

   When prompted, choose whether you want to manage your passwords:

   - **Y**: To manage your passwords.
   - **N**: To exit the application.

3. **Add a Password**:

   If you choose to add a password, you'll be prompted to enter the account name and the password. The password will be encrypted and saved in `password.txt`.

4. **View Passwords**:

   If you choose to view your passwords, the application will display all stored passwords in a user-friendly format.

## Important Notes

- **Data Storage**: Passwords are stored in plain text format within `password.txt`, but they are encrypted before being saved. Ensure you keep your `key.key` file secure, as it is necessary for decrypting your passwords.
- **Backup**: Regularly back up your `key.key` file to avoid losing access to your passwords.
  
## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication for additional security.
- Add the ability to update and delete passwords.
- Integrate a GUI for easier usage.
